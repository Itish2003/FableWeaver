He acts as a primary partner and ally alongside Tatsuya Shiba, forming a formidable duo that navigates the events of the series from the beginning. Kageaki's power is a dark existential anomaly: he creates Artificial Parasites from his own Psions, effectively fragmenting his own information-body to manifest entities and the Ten Shadows Technique. The narrative utilizes a 'Gradual Discovery' approach, where the full extent of his self-fragmentation and the true nature of his 'Shadows' are revealed slowly to both the characters and the reader. As a Course 1 'Bloom' with high social standing, he provides a political and tactical counterpoint to Tatsuya's 'Weed' status, while secretly operating as an Anomalous Strategic-Class asset in a state of constant self-containment."
