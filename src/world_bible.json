His power system, though mimicking Jujutsu Kaisen's CSM and Ten Shadows, is native to the Mahouka universe, powered by Psions and Pushions. He is a Course 1 student at First High (2095) who operates as a Planetary-scale threat and a deterrent against the Yotsuba. The story focuses on dark, psychological, and body-horror elements of his spirit manipulation. He hides his true nature behind the guise of 'Parade' illusions, with only Kudou Retsu knowing the full extent of his capabilities. He is indifferent to the Shiba siblings but senses their anomaly, focusing instead on his family's endgame and recruiting allies.",

        "content": "Story Framework: Irregular at Magic High School AU \u2014 Kudou (Elder Brother)\n\nCore Context\nName: Kudou Kageaki (\u4e45\u5802 \u5f71\u660e)\nAge: Same as Miyuki Shiba (16 at enrollment)\nEthnicity: Japanese\nHeight: ~6 ft\nAffiliation: Kudou Family \u2014 Designated Heir (Main Line)\nStatus: Unofficial Strategic Asset / First High Graduate (formerly Course 1)\nHe is the older brother of Minoru Kudou, and the first child of the Kudou main line to manifest a truly abnormal power system. While Minoru represents the family\u2019s theoretical peak, the elder brother represents its existential anomaly.\nWithin the family, his existence is treated as the future of the Kudou Family itself \u2014 dangerous, unconventional, and fully backed rather than hidden.\n\nBackstory\nThe Kudou Family specializes in mental interference, perception manipulation, and psion\u2011based cognition warfare. Their magic is subtle, precise, and terrifying in the hands of experts.\nThe elder brother was supposed to be the pinnacle of that tradition.\nInstead, during early adolescence, he manifested a power system that did not obey modern magic theory at all \u2014 one that fed on malice, fear, death, and negative emotional residue.\nRather than generating psions alone, he unconsciously produced and attracted cursed spirits.\nLater, this anomaly evolved further, awakening a second, inherited\u2011style system identical in structure to the Ten Shadows Technique.\nThe Kudou Family chose recognition over suppression.\nHe was formally acknowledged as heir, educated at the highest level, protected by the family\u2019s political weight, and trained to refine rather than suppress what could not be removed.\n\nPersonality Profile\nUnlike a cast-off anomaly, Kageaki was raised with authority, expectation, and institutional backing.\nHappy to go personality , cheerful, serious when needed.\nDisplays restrained empathy, especially toward victims of curses\nDeeply protective of Minoru, close to his brother\nUnlike Minoru, who fears himself, the elder brother fears losing control of what he commands.\n\nPower System Overview \u2014 Hybrid Jujutsu Framework\nHis abilities combine two separate but synergistic cursed systems:\nCursed Spirit Manipulation (CSM) \u2014 innate technique\nTen Shadows Technique (TST) \u2014 inherited\u2011style technique\nThis combination makes him uniquely dangerous, as both systems scale exponentially with time, conflict, and death.\n\nFundamental Jujutsu Techniques (Baseline Mastery)\nHe possesses complete proficiency in standard sorcerer techniques:\nCursed Energy Control\nHigh-output cursed energy generation\nPrecise suppression to avoid passive curse creation\nPhysical reinforcement for combat parity\nBarrier Techniques\nStandard barriers (containment, suppression, isolation)\nAnti-barrier understanding\nDomain countermeasures\nSimple Domain\nNeutralizes guaranteed-hit techniques\nDefensive deployment against hostile domains\nReverse Cursed Technique\nLimited but reliable self-healing\nStabilization of internal damage caused by cursed overload\nBlack Flash\nRare but devastating when achieved\nOften occurs unintentionally under emotional strain\n\nInnate Technique \u2014 Cursed Spirit Manipulation\nThis technique allows the user to exorcise, absorb, store, and command cursed spirits.\nCore Mechanics:\nDefeated cursed spirits can be absorbed into the user\u2019s body\nAbsorbed spirits can be:\nStored indefinitely\nSummoned and commanded\nCombined or sacrificed for amplified effects\nUsage Characteristics:\nSpirits retain their original abilities and personalities\nCommands must be reinforced with cursed energy and intent\nStronger spirits resist domination, requiring constant control\nAdvanced Applications:\nSpirit Fusion: Combining multiple curses into a single, unstable entity\nCurse Deployment: Releasing spirits as disposable weapons\nEnvironmental Saturation: Polluting areas with lingering curse presence\nUnlike typical users, his control is surgical rather than domineering \u2014 he avoids excess cruelty.\n\nInherited Technique \u2014 Ten Shadows Technique\nThe Ten Shadows Technique manifests alongside CSM, creating a layered summoning ecosystem.\nCore Capabilities:\nSummoning of up to ten shadow\u2011bound shikigami\nShadow storage for weapons, curses, or even himself\nShadow traversal and concealment\nKey Mechanics:\nDestroyed shikigami cannot be resummoned\nTheir residual power enhances surviving summons\nIncludes access to high-tier entities such as Mahoraga (sealed, last-resort)\nShikigami are fundamentally different from cursed spirits:\nShikigami are rule-bound constructs\nCursed spirits are autonomous, emotional entities\nThis distinction allows layered tactics.\n\nHybrid Synergy \u2014 Why This Is Dangerous\nThe coexistence of CSM and TST creates emergent abilities:\nShadow-Housed Curses: Storing cursed spirits within shadows\nShikigami-Curse Reinforcement: Feeding cursed energy into shikigami to alter behavior\nAdaptive Summons: Using curse data to inform shikigami evolution\nThis results in a battlefield where:\nTerrain is hostile\nSummons are expendable\nThreats escalate over time instead of diminishing\n\nDomain Potential (Unrealized)\nHe possesses the theoretical capacity to develop a Domain Expansion, though he has deliberately avoided it.\nSpeculated properties:\nA closed domain filled with layered shadows and bound curses\nGuaranteed-hit effects through curse command rather than direct attack\nExtreme difficulty to counter due to multi-source pressure\nThe Kudou Family has explicitly forbidden domain experimentation.\n\nPower Control & Psychological Cost\nConstant suppression is required to prevent ambient curse generation\nEmotional distress increases curse manifestation\nProlonged combat risks curse rebellion or shikigami loss\nHe maintains strict routines to stay grounded.\n\nPower Scaling (Irregular Verse)\nAverage Course 1 Magicians: Overwhelmed\nElite Magicians: Attrition-based victory\nStrategic-Class Assets: High-risk engagement\nTatsuya Shiba: Mutually catastrophic if escalated\nHe is classified as a persistent-area threat, not a burst-damage entity.\n\nRelationship Dynamics\nKudou Family\nFully supports Kageaki as the legitimate heir\nShields him from external interference and political predation\nTreats his power as an evolution of Kudou magic, not a corruption\n\n\nThemes\nFamily as obligation, not comfort\nPower that grows the longer it exists\n\n\nPower Scaling Appendix (Confidential)\nThis appendix exists to contextualize Kudou Kageaki\u2019s abilities relative to Jujutsu Kaisen canon feats and The Irregular at Magic High School power framework, ensuring internal consistency and proper escalation.\n\nI. Baseline Scaling Reference\nComparative Benchmarks\nKenjaku (CSM-only): ~6,462 curses total; capable of nation-level destabilization via Night Parade and city-level destruction via Maximum: Uzumaki.\nSukuna (Ten Shadows): City-to-multi-city destructive capacity; building-scale shikigami (Nue), adaptive conceptual counter via Mahoraga, domain-based annihilation.\nKudou Kageaki: Below Sukuna at absolute peak output, but exceeds Kenjaku in control density and versatility due to hybridization.\n\nII. Cursed Spirit Manipulation Scaling\nQuantity Tier\nLow Output: 10\u201350 curses (stealth, reconnaissance, suppression)\nModerate Output: 100\u2013300 curses (district-level domination)\nHigh Output: 1,000+ curses (citywide saturation; equivalent to partial Night Parade)\nQuality Tier\nGrade 4\u20132: Cannon fodder, barrier erosion\nGrade 1: Tactical units capable of defeating trained magicians\nSemi-Special: Threats to elite Course 1 combatants\nSpecial Grade: Strategic deterrents (each capable of leveling city blocks or defeating strategic-class magicians under the right conditions)\nMaximum Technique Analogue: Curse-fusion attacks equivalent to Uzumaki scale at city-level destructive force, limited by deliberate restraint rather than capacity.\n\nIII. Ten Shadows Technique Scaling\nIndividual Shikigami Output\nDivine Dogs (Unified): High-speed assassination; anti-curse specialists\nNue: Skyscraper-scale manifestation; lightning capable of city-grid disruption\nMax Elephant: Flood-level water release; infrastructure collapse\nPiercing Ox: Hyper-kinetic, linear destruction (reinforced buildings annihilated)\nRound Deer: Continuous regeneration + status nullification\nMahoraga: Conceptual adaptation (magic, psions, curses, information-based attacks)\nMahoraga alone places Kageaki at Strategic-Class Combat Tier.\n\nIV. Hybrid Synergy Multiplier\nKageaki\u2019s true scaling emerges from simultaneous system use:\nCurse swarms provide data for Mahoraga\u2019s adaptation\nShikigami act as mobile curse platforms\nShadow storage bypasses conventional detection\nBattlefield control operates on vertical, horizontal, and conceptual layers\nThis results in a non-linear power increase rather than additive scaling.\n\nV. Irregular World Classification\nMagic Association Internal Scale\nA-Class Magician: City block threat\nStrategic-Class Magician: City-scale annihilation\nAnomalous Strategic-Class: Power not governed by magic theory\nKudou Kageaki:\nAnomalous Strategic-Class (Hybrid Entity)\nEngagement Protocol: Avoid confrontation. Prioritize negotiation via Kudou Family.\n\nVI. Growth Curve & Narrative Ceiling\nCurrent State: Heavily restrained, defensive use preferred\nMid-Story Ceiling: Multi-city influence through curse logistics\nTheoretical Maximum: Continental destabilization if all restraints are removed (purely theoretical; politically implausible)\n\nVII. Summary Verdict\nKudou Kageaki is not designed as an instant apocalypse.\nHe is a slow, inevitable escalation \u2014 a power that grows quietly, legitimized by authority, and terrifying precisely because it is controlled.\n\n\nSwap 'Cursed Energy' with 'Psions and Pushions'. This would make the power source native to the universe. There are no drawbacks to using the abilities and they can be used to their full potential. The tone of the story needs to be 'Dark'.\n"
