# Story Framework: *Irregular at Magic High School* AU — **Kudou (Elder Brother)**

---

## Core Context

**Name:** Kudou Kageaki (久堂 影明)
**Age:** Same as Miyuki Shiba (16 at enrollment)
**Ethnicity:** Japanese
**Height:** ~6 ft

**Affiliation:** Kudou Family — **Designated Heir (Main Line)**
**Status:** Unofficial Strategic Asset / First High Graduate (formerly Course 1)

He is the **older brother of Minoru Kudou**, and the first child of the Kudou main line to manifest a truly abnormal power system. While Minoru represents the family’s *theoretical peak*, the elder brother represents its **existential anomaly**.

Within the family, his existence is treated as the **future of the Kudou Family itself** — dangerous, unconventional, and fully backed rather than hidden.

---

## Backstory

The Kudou Family specializes in mental interference, perception manipulation, and psion‑based cognition warfare. Their magic is subtle, precise, and terrifying in the hands of experts.

The elder brother was supposed to be the pinnacle of that tradition.

Instead, during early adolescence, he manifested a power system that **did not obey modern magic theory at all** — one that fed on malice, fear, death, and negative emotional residue.

Rather than generating psions alone, he unconsciously **produced and attracted cursed spirits**.

Later, this anomaly evolved further, awakening a second, inherited‑style system identical in structure to the **Ten Shadows Technique**.

The Kudou Family chose **recognition over suppression**.

He was formally acknowledged as heir, educated at the highest level, protected by the family’s political weight, and trained to refine rather than suppress what could not be removed.

---

## Personality Profile

Unlike a cast-off anomaly, Kageaki was raised with authority, expectation, and institutional backing.

* Quiet, watchful, and emotionally muted
* Displays restrained empathy, especially toward victims of curses
* Deeply protective of Minoru, even while keeping distance
* Carries a constant awareness of the harm he *could* cause

Unlike Minoru, who fears himself, the elder brother fears **losing control of what he commands**.

He does not seek approval, power, or leadership. He seeks **containment** — of himself.

---

## Power System Overview — Hybrid Jujutsu Framework

His abilities combine two separate but synergistic cursed systems:

1. **Cursed Spirit Manipulation (CSM)** — innate technique
2. **Ten Shadows Technique (TST)** — inherited‑style technique

This combination makes him uniquely dangerous, as both systems scale exponentially with time, conflict, and death.

---

## Fundamental Jujutsu Techniques (Baseline Mastery)

He possesses complete proficiency in standard sorcerer techniques:

### Cursed Energy Control

* High-output cursed energy generation
* Precise suppression to avoid passive curse creation
* Physical reinforcement for combat parity

### Barrier Techniques

* Standard barriers (containment, suppression, isolation)
* Anti-barrier understanding
* Domain countermeasures

### Simple Domain

* Neutralizes guaranteed-hit techniques
* Defensive deployment against hostile domains

### Reverse Cursed Technique

* Limited but reliable self-healing
* Stabilization of internal damage caused by cursed overload

### Black Flash

* Rare but devastating when achieved
* Often occurs unintentionally under emotional strain

---

## Innate Technique — **Cursed Spirit Manipulation**

This technique allows the user to **exorcise, absorb, store, and command cursed spirits**.

### Core Mechanics:

* Defeated cursed spirits can be absorbed into the user’s body
* Absorbed spirits can be:

  * Stored indefinitely
  * Summoned and commanded
  * Combined or sacrificed for amplified effects

### Usage Characteristics:

* Spirits retain their original abilities and personalities
* Commands must be reinforced with cursed energy and intent
* Stronger spirits resist domination, requiring constant control

### Advanced Applications:

* **Spirit Fusion:** Combining multiple curses into a single, unstable entity
* **Curse Deployment:** Releasing spirits as disposable weapons
* **Environmental Saturation:** Polluting areas with lingering curse presence

Unlike typical users, his control is surgical rather than domineering — he avoids excess cruelty.

---

## Inherited Technique — **Ten Shadows Technique**

The Ten Shadows Technique manifests alongside CSM, creating a layered summoning ecosystem.

### Core Capabilities:

* Summoning of up to ten shadow‑bound shikigami
* Shadow storage for weapons, curses, or even himself
* Shadow traversal and concealment

### Key Mechanics:

* Destroyed shikigami cannot be resummoned
* Their residual power enhances surviving summons
* Includes access to high-tier entities such as **Mahoraga** (sealed, last-resort)

Shikigami are fundamentally different from cursed spirits:

* Shikigami are rule-bound constructs
* Cursed spirits are autonomous, emotional entities

This distinction allows layered tactics.

---

## Hybrid Synergy — Why This Is Dangerous

The coexistence of CSM and TST creates emergent abilities:

* **Shadow-Housed Curses:** Storing cursed spirits within shadows
* **Shikigami-Curse Reinforcement:** Feeding cursed energy into shikigami to alter behavior
* **Adaptive Summons:** Using curse data to inform shikigami evolution

This results in a battlefield where:

* Terrain is hostile
* Summons are expendable
* Threats escalate over time instead of diminishing

---

## Domain Potential (Unrealized)

He possesses the theoretical capacity to develop a Domain Expansion, though he has deliberately avoided it.

Speculated properties:

* A closed domain filled with layered shadows and bound curses
* Guaranteed-hit effects through curse command rather than direct attack
* Extreme difficulty to counter due to multi-source pressure

The Kudou Family has explicitly forbidden domain experimentation.

---

## Power Control & Psychological Cost

* Constant suppression is required to prevent ambient curse generation
* Emotional distress increases curse manifestation
* Prolonged combat risks curse rebellion or shikigami loss

He maintains strict routines to stay grounded.

---

## Power Scaling (Irregular Verse)

* **Average Course 1 Magicians:** Overwhelmed
* **Elite Magicians:** Attrition-based victory
* **Strategic-Class Assets:** High-risk engagement
* **Tatsuya Shiba:** Mutually catastrophic if escalated

He is classified as a **persistent-area threat**, not a burst-damage entity.

---

## Relationship Dynamics

### Minoru Kudou

* Fierce, silent protectiveness
* Acts as a hidden shield rather than a guide

### Kudou Family

* Fully supports Kageaki as the legitimate heir
* Shields him from external interference and political predation
* Treats his power as an evolution of Kudou magic, not a corruption

### Other Great Families

* Vaguely aware something is "wrong"
* Avoid direct provocation

---

## Role in Canon Timeline

* Appears rarely, decisively
* Handles incidents involving cursed anomalies or unknown entities
* Acts behind the scenes during major conflicts

---

## Themes

* Control vs Contamination
* Family as obligation, not comfort
* Power that grows the longer it exists

---

## Long-Term Narrative Direction

His arc is not about growth in strength.

It is about **how long containment can last** — and what happens when it finally fails.

---

# Power Scaling Appendix (Confidential)

This appendix exists to contextualize Kudou Kageaki’s abilities relative to **Jujutsu Kaisen canon feats** and **The Irregular at Magic High School power framework**, ensuring internal consistency and proper escalation.

---

## I. Baseline Scaling Reference

### Comparative Benchmarks

* **Kenjaku (CSM-only):** ~6,462 curses total; capable of nation-level destabilization via Night Parade and city-level destruction via Maximum: Uzumaki.
* **Sukuna (Ten Shadows):** City-to-multi-city destructive capacity; building-scale shikigami (Nue), adaptive conceptual counter via Mahoraga, domain-based annihilation.

**Kudou Kageaki:** Below Sukuna at absolute peak output, but **exceeds Kenjaku in control density and versatility** due to hybridization.

---

## II. Cursed Spirit Manipulation Scaling

### Quantity Tier

* **Low Output:** 10–50 curses (stealth, reconnaissance, suppression)
* **Moderate Output:** 100–300 curses (district-level domination)
* **High Output:** 1,000+ curses (citywide saturation; equivalent to partial Night Parade)

### Quality Tier

* Grade 4–2: Cannon fodder, barrier erosion
* Grade 1: Tactical units capable of defeating trained magicians
* Semi-Special: Threats to elite Course 1 combatants
* Special Grade: Strategic deterrents (each capable of leveling city blocks or defeating strategic-class magicians under the right conditions)

**Maximum Technique Analogue:** Curse-fusion attacks equivalent to Uzumaki scale at **city-level destructive force**, limited by deliberate restraint rather than capacity.

---

## III. Ten Shadows Technique Scaling

### Individual Shikigami Output

* **Divine Dogs (Unified):** High-speed assassination; anti-curse specialists
* **Nue:** Skyscraper-scale manifestation; lightning capable of city-grid disruption
* **Max Elephant:** Flood-level water release; infrastructure collapse
* **Piercing Ox:** Hyper-kinetic, linear destruction (reinforced buildings annihilated)
* **Round Deer:** Continuous regeneration + status nullification
* **Mahoraga:** Conceptual adaptation (magic, psions, curses, information-based attacks)

Mahoraga alone places Kageaki at **Strategic-Class Combat Tier**.

---

## IV. Hybrid Synergy Multiplier

Kageaki’s true scaling emerges from **simultaneous system use**:

* Curse swarms provide data for Mahoraga’s adaptation
* Shikigami act as mobile curse platforms
* Shadow storage bypasses conventional detection
* Battlefield control operates on vertical, horizontal, and conceptual layers

This results in a **non-linear power increase** rather than additive scaling.

---

## V. Irregular World Classification

### Magic Association Internal Scale

* **A-Class Magician:** City block threat
* **Strategic-Class Magician:** City-scale annihilation
* **Anomalous Strategic-Class:** Power not governed by magic theory

**Kudou Kageaki:**

> *Anomalous Strategic-Class (Hybrid Entity)*

Engagement Protocol: Avoid confrontation. Prioritize negotiation via Kudou Family.

---

## VI. Growth Curve & Narrative Ceiling

* **Current State:** Heavily restrained, defensive use preferred
* **Mid-Story Ceiling:** Multi-city influence through curse logistics
* **Theoretical Maximum:** Continental destabilization if all restraints are removed (purely theoretical; politically implausible)

---

## VII. Summary Verdict

Kudou Kageaki is not designed as an instant apocalypse.
He is a **slow, inevitable escalation** — a power that grows quietly, legitimized by authority, and terrifying precisely because it is controlled.
