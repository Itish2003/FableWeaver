    "user_intent": "# Story Framework: *Irregular at Magic High School* AU \u2014 **Kudou (Elder Brother)**\n\n---\n\n## Core Context\n\n**Name:** Kudou Kageaki (\u4e45\u5802 \u5f71\u660e)\n**Age:** Same as Miyuki Shiba (16 at enrollment)\n**Ethnicity:** Japanese\n**Height:** ~6 ft\n\n**Affiliation:** Kudou Family \u2014 **Designated Heir (Main Line)**\n**Status:** Unofficial Strategic Asset / First High Graduate (formerly Course 1)\n\nHe is the **older brother of Minoru Kudou**, and the first child of the Kudou main line to manifest a truly abnormal power system. While Minoru represents the family\u2019s *theoretical peak*, the elder brother represents its **existential anomaly**.\n\nWithin the family, his existence is treated as the **future of the Kudou Family itself** \u2014 dangerous, unconventional, and fully backed rather than hidden.\n\n---\n\n## Backstory\n\nThe Kudou Family specializes in **Ancient Magic (Spirit Magic)**, dealing with mental interference, perception manipulation, and Pushion\u2011based cognition warfare.\n\nThe elder brother was supposed to be the pinnacle of that tradition.\n\nInstead, during early adolescence, he manifested a power system that **deviated from standard Modern Magic Theory**. His psion calculation area did not just process magic sequences; it interacted directly with the **Pushion Information Dimension** in a way that fed on malice, fear, and negative thought emissions.\n\nRather than generating standard magic sequences, he unconsciously **produced and attracted Autonomous Information Bodies** (spirits/parasites born of negative emotion).\n\nLater, this anomaly evolved further, awakening a second, inherited\u2011style system utilizing shadows as a medium for Psion construction, identical in structure to the **Ten Shadows Technique**.\n\nThe Kudou Family chose **recognition over suppression**.\n\nHe was formally acknowledged as heir, educated at the highest level, protected by the family\u2019s political weight, and trained to refine rather than suppress what could not be removed.\n\n---\n\n## Personality Profile\n\nUnlike a cast-off anomaly, Kageaki was raised with authority, expectation, and institutional backing.\n\n* Quiet, watchful, and emotionally muted\n* Displays restrained empathy, especially toward victims of 'Spirit' phenomena\n* Deeply protective of Minoru, even while keeping distance\n* Carries a constant awareness of the harm he *could* cause\n\nUnlike Minoru, who fears himself, the elder brother fears **losing control of what he commands**.\n\nHe does not seek approval, power, or leadership. He seeks **containment** \u2014 of himself.\n\n---\n\n## Power System Overview \u2014 Psion/Pushion Hybrid Framework\n\nHis abilities combine two separate but synergistic systems rooted in **Ancient Magic** principles, fully integrated into the physics of Psions (structure) and Pushions (thought/emotion):\n\n1. **Spirit Manipulation (CSM Analogue)** \u2014 Innate ability to manipulate Autonomous Information Bodies.\n2. **Ten Shadows Technique (TST Analogue)** \u2014 Shadow-medium Psion Construction.\n\nThis combination makes him uniquely dangerous, as both systems scale exponentially with the accumulation of information bodies and combat data.\n\n---\n\n## Fundamental Techniques (Baseline Mastery)\n\nHe possesses complete proficiency in standard magician techniques, adapted to his unique composition:\n\n### Psion/Pushion Control\n\n* High-output Psion generation\n* **Pushion Suppression:** Preventing his own emotional state from leaking into the Information Dimension and creating spirits.\n* **Body Reinforcement:** Using Psions to reinforce physical durability (similar to Fortification Magic).\n\n### Barrier Magic\n\n* Standard barriers (containment, suppression, isolation)\n* **Cast Jamming / Antinite:** Innate understanding of interference due to the 'noise' his spirits generate.\n* **Domain Countermeasures:** Techniques to disrupt the activation sequence of hostile magic.\n\n### Self-Restoration (RCT Analogue)\n\n* Utilization of high-density Pushions to overwrite damage to his own Eidos, effectively \"healing\" physical wounds by reverting the information body.\n\n---\n\n## Innate Technique \u2014 **Spirit Manipulation**\n\nThis technique allows the user to **capture, store, and command Autonomous Information Bodies (Spirits/Parasites)**.\n\n### Core Mechanics:\n\n* **Absorption:** Defeated or destabilized Information Bodies (spirits) are absorbed into his own Psion Information Body.\n* **Storage:** Spirits are stored within his personal Pushion field.\n* **Command:** Spirits can be materialized into the physical world using Psions as a shell.\n\n### Usage Characteristics:\n\n* Spirits retain their original interference capabilities (mental attacks, element inducement).\n* Commands are enforced via Pushion domination (willpower).\n* Stronger spirits (high-density Pushion entities) resist domination, requiring constant mental focus.\n\n### Advanced Applications:\n\n* **Spirit Fusion:** Combining multiple Information Bodies into a single, high-density Psion entity (Maximum Uzumaki analogue).\n* **Deployment:** Releasing spirits as disposable interference weapons.\n* **Pollution:** Saturating an area with Pushion noise to disrupt modern magic activation sequences (similar to Cast Jamming).\n\n---\n\n## Inherited Technique \u2014 **Ten Shadows (Shadow Construction)**\n\nThe Ten Shadows Technique manifests alongside Spirit Manipulation, using shadows as a medium to manifest pre-programmed Psion Constructs (Shikigami).\n\n### Core Capabilities:\n\n* Summoning of up to ten shadow\u2011bound constructs.\n* **Shadow Storage:** Storing physical objects, spirits, or himself within the shadow dimension (a pocket of the Information Dimension).\n\n### Key Mechanics:\n\n* **Irreversible Loss:** If a construct's information definition is destroyed, it cannot be re-manifested.\n* **Inheritance:** The Psion patterns of destroyed constructs merge into the remaining ones.\n* **Mahoraga (The Divine General):** An adaptive construct capable of analyzing and adapting to any Magic Sequence or Psion phenomenon.\n\n**Difference from Spirits:**\n* **Shikigami:** Stable, rule-bound Psion Constructs (Artificial).\n* **Spirits:** Volatile, emotional Pushion Entities (Natural/Chaotic).\n\n---\n\n## Hybrid Synergy\n\nThe coexistence of these systems creates emergent abilities:\n\n* **Shadow-Housed Spirits:** Storing volatile spirits within the stable shadow medium.\n* **Construct-Spirit Reinforcement:** Feeding high-density Pushions (spirits) into Shikigami to alter their behavior or output.\n* **Adaptive Evolution:** Using spirit data to accelerate Mahoraga\u2019s adaptation logic.\n\n---\n\n## Domain Potential (Unrealized)\n\nHe possesses the theoretical capacity to deploy a **Closed Barrier Field** (Domain Expansion).\n\nSpeculated properties:\n\n* A barrier that imposes his internal Pushion Landscape onto reality.\n* Guaranteed interference effects (magic sequences fail or strike automatically).\n* Extreme difficulty to Counter-Magic due to the sheer density of information.\n\nThe Kudou Family has explicitly forbidden experimentation with this level of interference.\n\n---\n\n## Power Scaling (Irregular Verse)\n\n* **Average Course 1 Magicians:** Overwhelmed by spirit interference (Cast Jamming effect).\n* **Elite Magicians:** Attrition-based victory.\n* **Strategic-Class Assets:** High-risk engagement. He counters large-scale magic by disrupting the caster mentally (Spirit attacks) or physically (Shikigami).\n* **Tatsuya Shiba:** Mutually catastrophic. Tatsuya can decompose the spirits/constructs, but the sheer volume of Pushion noise acts as a counter to Tatsuya's perception speed.\n\nHe is classified as a **Walking Magic Jammer** and **Strategic-Threat Entity**.\n\n---\n\n## Relationship Dynamics\n\n### Minoru Kudou\n\n* Fierce, silent protectiveness.\n* Minoru represents the \"Perfect Human\" (physical/magical balance); Kageaki represents the \"Spirit Sovereign\" (mental/spiritual dominance).\n\n### Kudou Family\n\n* Fully supports Kageaki as the legitimate heir.\n* Views his ability to manipulate Information Bodies as the holy grail of Kudou research (controlled Parasite usage).\n\n---\n\n## Power Scaling Appendix (Confidential)\n\n### I. Baseline Scaling Reference\n\n* **Kenjaku Analogue:** Capable of destabilizing a nation via massive spirit riots (Pushion storms).\n* **Sukuna Analogue:** City-scale destruction via high-output Psion blasts and adaptive constructs.\n\n**Kudou Kageaki:** Below Tatsuya in direct destruction (Material Burst), but superior in **mental interference and versatility**.\n\n### II. Spirit Manipulation (Pushion Scale)\n\n* **Low Output:** 10\u201350 spirits (Stealth/Spying).\n* **High Output:** 1,000+ spirits (City-wide Magic Jamming/Panic induction).\n\n### III. Ten Shadows (Psion Scale)\n\n* **Mahoraga:** Capable of adapting to *Gram Demolition* or *Phalanx* given time.\n\n### IV. Irregular World Classification\n\n**Kudou Kageaki:**\n> *Anomalous Strategic-Class (Spirit/Hybrid Entity)*\n> Engagement Protocol: Avoid confrontation. Prioritize negotiation via Kudou Family.\n"
