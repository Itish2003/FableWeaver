His powers, Cursed Spirit Manipulation and the Ten Shadows Technique, have been re-contextualized as a unique evolution of Kudou mental interference magic, fueled by Psions and Pushions rather than Cursed Energy. This makes his abilities native to the Irregular universe. He operates at a Strategic-Class level with no drawbacks, capable of manifesting his full potential. The story follows a dark tone where his power is not a curse to be suppressed, but a legitimate and terrifying asset of the Kudou bloodline."
