    "user_intent": "# Story Framework: *Irregular at Magic High School* AU \u2014 **Kudou (Elder Brother)**\n\n---\n\n## Core Context\n\n**Name:** Kudou Kageaki (\u4e45\u5802 \u5f71\u660e)\n**Age:** Same as Miyuki Shiba (16 at enrollment)\n**Affiliation:** Kudou Family \u2014 **Designated Heir**\n**Status:** Unofficial Strategic Asset / Ancient Magic User\n\nHe is the **older brother of Minoru Kudou**, representing the family's **existential anomaly**. While Minoru represents the theoretical peak of modern magic, Kageaki represents the terrifying potential of **Ancient Magic** pushed to its absolute limit.\n\n---\n\n## Magic System Adaptation: Psion & Pushion\n\nInstead of \"Cursed Energy,\" Kageaki's abilities are grounded entirely in **Mahouka's magic physics**, specifically focusing on **Pushions** (Spirit Particles) and **Psions** (Thought Particles).\n\n### 1. The Anomaly: Pushion Information Bodies (Substitute for Cursed Spirits)\n\nIn the Mahouka universe, strong emotions and thoughts release Pushions. Kageaki possesses a unique constitution that acts as a **Pushion Sink**.\n\n*   **Phenomenon:** He naturally attracts loose Pushions generated by human malice, fear, and death.\n*   **Manifestation:** These Pushions aggregate into semi-autonomous **Information Bodies** (similar to Parasites or traditional Spirits). To the uninitiated, they look like \"curses,\" but they are defined as rogue Information Bodies.\n*   **Technique - Spirit Manipulation (CSM):**\n    *   He does not \"exorcise\" them; he **rewrites their Information Body structure** to assimilate them into his own Psion Information Body.\n    *   He can store these entities within his own subconscious (Pushion field) and deploy them as autonomous weapons.\n\n### 2. The Lineage: Shadow Medium Magic (Substitute for Ten Shadows)\n\nThis is a highly advanced form of **Ancient Magic** passed down in the Kudou bloodline (specifically compatible with their focus on mental interference).\n\n*   **Mechanics:** Uses shadows as a physical medium to manifest high-density **Psion Constructs** (Shikigami).\n*   **Difference from Spirits:** Unlike the chaotic Pushion entities he absorbs, these Shikigami are stable, rule-bound Psion structures anchored by the user's calculation area.\n\n---\n\n## Power System Overview\n\n### Innate Magic: Spirit Assimilation (CSM Equivalent)\n*   **Source:** External (Wild Pushion Entities).\n*   **Function:** Capturing rogue Information Bodies (Spirits/Parasites) and utilizing their unique interference properties.\n*   **Application:** Mental interference attacks, physical poltergeist phenomena, surveillance.\n*   **Mahouka Context:** The Magic Association classifies this as a high-risk \"Spirit Magic\" capable of countering Parasites effectively.\n\n### Inherited Magic: The Ten Shadows (Ancient Magic)\n*   **Source:** Internal (Psion Manipulation).\n*   **Function:** Summoning Psion Constructs through shadow media.\n*   **Mahouka Context:** Viewed as a versatile Ancient Magic system superior to many Modern Magic summoning sequences due to its adaptability and the autonomy of the constructs.\n*   **Mahoraga:** A construct capable of **\"Sequence Adaptation\"**\u2014analyzing an opponent's Activation Sequence and rewriting its own Psion structure to bypass or neutralize the magic.\n\n---\n\n## Synergies & Hazards\n\n*   **Pushion Contamination:** Because he absorbs entities made of negative emotion (Pushions), he is at constant risk of losing his own sense of self/sanity. He requires high-level mental interference defenses (Kudou specialty) to remain stable.\n*   **Hybrid Attacks:** He can house volatile Pushion Spirits *inside* his stable Psion Shikigami, creating \"possessed\" summons that are significantly more dangerous than standard magic.\n\n---\n\n## Power Scaling (Mahouka Context)\n\n*   **Class:** Anomalous Strategic-Class (due to the unquantifiable nature of Spirit Magic).\n*   **Combat Style:** Anti-Magic / Mental Interference / Area Denial.\n*   **Vs. Modern Magic:** Modern mages struggle against him because his \"Spirits\" (Pushion bodies) are difficult to target with standard physical-interference magic.\n*   **Relation to Tatsuya:** Kageaki deals with the **Mind/Spirit (Pushion)** aspect of reality, while Tatsuya deals with the **Material/Event (Psion)** aspect. They are opposite sides of the catastrophe coin."
